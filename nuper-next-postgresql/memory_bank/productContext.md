# Product Context: Nuper

## 1. Problem Statement

Nuper is a platform designed to connect creative individuals and teams, allowing them to showcase their projects, announce events, and share updates. The initial architecture, while effective for a prototype, presents challenges in scalability and data management as the user base grows.

## 2. User Experience Goals

- **Seamless Transition:** Users should not experience any disruption or significant change in the user interface during and after the migration. The look, feel, and functionality must be preserved.
- **Performance Enhancement:** Users should notice faster page loads, especially on content-heavy pages like project listings and event details.
- **Reliability:** The platform must be stable and reliable, with consistent data across all views.

## 3. Core Features

The platform's core features will be preserved in the new architecture:
- User authentication (Login/Register).
- Project submission and browsing.
- Event creation and listing.
- Bulletin board for announcements.
- Admin panel for content management.
- User profiles and dashboards.
