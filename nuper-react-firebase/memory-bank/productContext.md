# Product Context

## Problem Solved
The platform addresses the fragmentation of information for students looking for career-related events, news, and project funding opportunities. It provides a single, trusted source for high-quality content and connections.

## User Experience (UX) Goals

3. **Admin Efficiency:** Provide a comprehensive, secure, and fast admin interface for content creators.

## Monetization Strategy (Initial Focus)
The path to sustainability starts with creating **premium visibility** as a marketable asset:
1. **Sponsored Content:** Monetize the "Featured Event" flag by offering top visibility placement on the homepage and event listings.
2. **Affiliate/Donation:** Add links to Patreon or simple donation methods on high-traffic or high-trust pages (About, Footer).
